_EXPERIMENTAL:
	can enable experimental features in some builds, likely not stable

_NAND_DRIVER:
	will enable building the NAND-driver in the future, which will allow reading (and maybe writing) files without the OS being present,
	which is good for standalone-mode

_USB_DRIVER:
	will enable the usb host controller driver in the future. All other usb drivers depend on this


_DISABLE_TEXT_OUTPUT:
	disables the status output at the start, and the clock if enabled


_CLOCK:
	enables the miniclock

_BACKGROUND_IMAGES:
	enables replacing the black of the nspire homescreen with a 320x240 bmp file(s) named background.bmp to background3.bmp.
	Cycles through them if more than background.bmp are there (if they are in continuously numbered).
