Copy the files in the binutils and GCC directories into the source directories of gcc and bunutils respectively.
Keep the directory structure inside these directories, for example gcc/fixincludes/mkfixinc.sh goes into (gcc source)/fixincludes

After copying the files run:
automake in (your binutils source)/ld
autoconf in (your GCC source)/libstdc++-v3


Then make a build directories for GCC and binutils
Also make a directory for the finished executables and add it to your PATH


run:
cd (your binutils build directory)
(your binutils source directory)/configure --target=arm-osext --prefix=(your executable directory) --with-sysroot=(path to the OSExt sysroot newlib folder) --disable-nls
make
make install

cd (your gcc build directory)

(your GCC source directory)/configure --target=arm-osext --prefix=(your executable directory) --with-sysroot=(path to the OSExt sysroot newlib folder) --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-nls
make all-gcc
make all-target-libgcc
make install-gcc
make install-target-libgcc
